## MEVN-todos

On the surface, this is a rudimentary todo app--and it is. But this project is fleshed out beyond what is necessary for something this simple. That's because I'm using this to create a foundation from which to build future apps. When I'm done with this and I want to create something I will actually deploy, this will act as a starter template.

Some of the features of this app are:
* Transactional emails
* Authentication system including
  * Facebook login
  * Google login
  * Fully fleshed out local login with email confirmation and password reset
* Vue.js frontend
* Server-Side Rendering with Nuxt.js
